# FreeMinecraftResources
A Minecraft plugin is an executable jar capable of understanding the Spigot API (What most Minecraft Servers use to run).
Most resources located in this repository can be downloaded or viewed live here:

Larger Plugins may be a standalone repository.
All plugins use the Java Programing language.

This in particular is an up-to-date version of ElytraParkour with a few added options.
* Run commands at completion of map
* Check if player is on ground and send them back to map spawn
* Check if player has fallen into the void and teleport them back to map spawn
